All the code in this framework is under the X11 license
(http://techbase.kde.org/Policies/Licensing_Policy#X11_License) and, as
such, the source code for this framework can be distributed according to
that license.

However, once built, the library and test executables will link against
LGPL libraries (and potentially GPL ones), and so any binary package
will be subject to those licenses.
